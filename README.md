# Employee Attrition and Department Classification Model

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict employee attrition and department classification. The model is trained on employee data to predict two targets:
1. **Attrition**: Whether an employee will leave the company (binary classification: 1 for attrition, 0 for no attrition).
2. **Department**: The department to which an employee belongs (multi-class classification).
